//! Native TTS provider framework.
//!
//! Object-safe provider contract shared by Supertonic 3 (default),
//! Qwen3-TTS 1.7B GGUF/ONNX (opt-in) and GPT-SoVITS (ONNX). All inference runs in the SonicBoom
//! process: non-`Send` model internals are encapsulated in dedicated
//! in-process worker threads with bounded channels, never subprocesses.
